## Experience

I hold a Bachelor of Science with a major in Computer Science from the University of Otago. I specialised in web application development and distributed information systems.

I started my career in 2011 while studying, cutting my teeth in a marketing agency environment building full stack web applications. After graduating, I joined a fast-paced content marketing startup and lead the design and implementation of the backend using RESTful web services.

At PocketSmith, I'm responsible for engineering our various Ruby web applications, ensuring that—as a team—we're delivering high quality, efficient, scalable and secure technical solutions. I work closely with the CTO, and form part of our leadership group, providing a technical voice to the company's strategy and direction, as well as everyday operations.
