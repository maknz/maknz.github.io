# Regan McEntyre

Hi, I'm Regan! I'm a software engineer based in Dunedin, New Zealand. Currently I'm a lead software engineer at [PocketSmith](https://www.pocketsmith.com)â€”smart tools that let you forge your own financial path.

## Experience

I hold a Bachelor of Science with a major in Computer Science from the University of Otago. I specialised in web application development and distributed information systems.

I started my career in 2011 while studying, cutting my teeth in a marketing agency environment building full stack web applications. After graduating, I joined a fast-paced content marketing startup and lead the design and implementation of the backend using RESTful web services.

I've worked across a broad range of languages and frameworks, including Ruby (and Rails), and PHP.
